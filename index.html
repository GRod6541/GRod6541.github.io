                <h3>What is Python</h3>
                <p>Python is a programming language created by Guido Van Rossum <br>and 
                    officially released in 1991.                
                </p>
                <p>It has numerous applications such as in web development,
                    in mathemetics, in data scienc, in system scripting, and in software
                    developement among many others.

                <h3>Python Syntax</h3>
                <p>Python was primarily designed for easy readability. It has numerous
                    similarities with natural languages like English. It has also received

                    influences from mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>Unlike other programming languages which use semicolon or parenthesis to
                complete commands, Python uses new lines instead.<br>
                Python has identation, to define scope like the ones found in loops,
                functions and classes, while other programming languages use curly braces.
                </p>

        <footer>It is thus good to learn python. Some good places
            to start would be w3schools website, the Python 
            official documentation, and realpython website.
