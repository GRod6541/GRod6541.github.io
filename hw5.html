        website for the Internet
         (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can

         web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

    <p> Apart from HTML an CSS, you can have fun to with Javascript. for instance, the Uphill Text script renders text with ascending font sizes (from font size 1 to 7),
         starting over when it hits 7. Great and efficient way of sprucing up selected messages on your site!<br>
